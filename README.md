# Explaining the CS Flashcard Study Game

Imagine you have a stack of special cards that help you study for school. 

But instead of real cards you hold in your hand, these are magic digital cards on your computer!

What Does This Project Do?

It's like a video game for learning! Here's how it works:

Pick Your Topic: You click on a button that says what you want to study (like "Hash Tables" or "Sorting")

See a Card: A big, colorful card appears on your screen with a word or phrase on it (like "Bubble Sort")

Flip It: When you click the card, it spins around like a coin flipping in the air and shows you what that word means on the back

Move Through Cards: You can press buttons or use arrow keys on your keyboard to go to the next card or go back to the previous one

What Are All These Files?

Think of it like building a treehouse:

index.html - This is like the floor and walls of your treehouse. It's the main structure.

styles.css - This is like the paint and decorations. It makes everything look pretty with colors and animations.

app.js - This is like the secret mechanisms that make doors open and ladders work. It makes the cards flip and buttons work.

serve.py - This is like a magic door that lets you walk into your treehouse easily. It opens up the project in your web browser.

README.md - This is like the instruction manual that tells you how everything works.

How Do You Use It?

You tell your computer to run a special command (using the serve.py file)

A website opens up automatically

You click buttons to study different topics

You click cards to flip them and see answers

You keep clicking "Next" until you've studied all the cards

It's basically a digital flip-card game that helps you memorize computer stuff for school! 
Instead of paper cards that you carry around, you have them on your computer with cool spinning animations.
